%% Conference name definitions
% For every conference, there should be two strings:  one with the
% base name, and one prefixed by "l-".  The l-version is the "long"
% name and the base version is the short name.  The bibtex script
% will generate zives-long.bib and zives-short.bib from zives.bib.
% In the .tex file, include the appropriate bib file depending on
% whether you want short or long names.
%
% New 4/03: a series of new BibTeX fields has been added:
%  url = {url}    Becomes a note field with "Available from" the
%                 specified URL
%  urlpub = {url} Becomes a howpublished filed with "Available from" URL
%  urlXXX = {url} Becomes a note field with XXX URL (substitute your
%                 text)
%  organization   Removed from short file
%  publisher      Removed from short file
%  isbn           Removed from short file
%  publisher      Denotes a publisher that shows up in short or long file
%
%
% Long/short version by zives, 5/7/02
%
% Re-organization of file by category, zives 7/21/02
