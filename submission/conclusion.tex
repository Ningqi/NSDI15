This paper champions a shift from OS/PL to DB-oriented techniques
towards more flexible and manageable networks. Our \Sys approach
features customizable abstractions, realtime verification and
synthesis, and transaction processing by applying DB principles of
\textit{data independence} and \textit{transaction processing} into
networking domain. % to efficiently schedule user programs in a shared
% environment while preserving ACID.
While this is an ambitious long-term goal, a prototype of several core
features demonstrates promising performance.
% , showing \Sys induced per rule update latency is as small as 14ms,
% for the most expensive DB operation on datacenter networks of 10k
% nodes (4.3k edges) We also discuss the opportunities, challenges,
% and limits of \Sys.
