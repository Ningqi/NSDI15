Using rib_batch.py

- "Input RIB size: d for default number (all), or the number of feeds:"
Input either an integer or just the character 'd',
the integer represents the number of Ribs used, e.g. you can input
1000, meaning 1000 rib feed is used to generate flow entries. Each rib
feed results in the install of one path, so a few flow entries along
the path will be produced.
Avoid 'd', that means using all feeds, over 2million of them, causing
shortest path computations 2million times.

- 'Input the x-th largest AS: '
Here you input an integer between 0 to 10; or 'e'.
The integers correspond to 10 ASes, sorted by their size.
0 is the smallest AS with several hundreds nodes, 9 is the largest one
with several 10'000 nodes.
You can repeatedly input a set of integers, and let the script
generate the actual DB by hitting 'e'.

The DB generated is named like this:
as***ribxxx:
*** is the actual AS number, xxx is the number of rib feeds used (d,
if all feeds used).
